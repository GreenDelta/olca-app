Note that also the completeness of interim product and waste flows in the product model contributes to the overall completeness of the inventory.\r\n\r\nPrecision: Measure of the variability of the data values for each data expressed (e.g. low variance = high precision).\r\n\r\nMethodological appropriateness and consistency: The applied LCI methods and methodological choices (e.g. allocation, substitution, etc.) are in line with the goal and scope of the data set, especially its intended applications and decision support context (e.g. monitoring, product-specific decision support, strategic long-term decision support). The methods also have been consistently applied across all data including for included processes, if any.\r\n\r\nOverall quality: The degree to which the data set’s overall representativeness, completeness, precision as well as methodological appropriateness and consistency reflects the reality the data set is representing.",
