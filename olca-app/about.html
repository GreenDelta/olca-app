        Version 2, June 1991

        Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
        59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA

        Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
        document, but changing it is not allowed.

        Preamble

        The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
        and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
        guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
        software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to
        most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose
        authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
        covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
        your programs, too.

        When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our
        General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
        distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
        that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
        the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you
        can do these things.

        To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
        you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions
        translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
        software, or if you modify it.

        For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for
        a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must
        make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must
        show them these terms so they know their rights.

        We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
        offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
        and/or modify the software.

        Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
        everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the
        software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
        know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced
        by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

        Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We
        wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
        individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.
        To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for
        everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

        The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
        follow.

        TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

        0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
        placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of
        this General Public License.  The "Program", below, refers to any such program
        or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
        derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
        Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
        translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included
        without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as
        "you".

        Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
        this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is
        not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
        constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by
        running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

        1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as
        you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
        appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
        disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
        and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
        Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

        You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
        at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

        2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus
        forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications
        or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
        these conditions:

            a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
            that you changed the files and the date of any change.

            b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
            in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
            licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
            this License.

            c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
            you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the
            most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
            appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
            else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
            the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy
            of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does
            not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is
            not required to print an announcement.)

        These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable
        sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
        considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
        its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
        works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
        work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms
        of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
        whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

        Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
        rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
        right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
        the Program.

        In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the
        Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
        distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
        License.

        3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
        Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and
        2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

            a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
            code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
            on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

            b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
            give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
            performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
            corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
            and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

            c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
            distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only
            for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
            object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
            Subsection b above.)

        The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
        modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all
        the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
        definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation
        of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code
        distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
        source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)
        of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
        itself accompanies the executable.

        If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy
        from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source
        code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though
        third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

        4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
        expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
        sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate
        your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or
        rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
        long as such parties remain in full compliance.

        5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
        However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program
        or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not
        accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or
        any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to
        do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
        the Program or works based on it.

        6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
        the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
        copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.
        You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
        rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
        third parties to this License.

        7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
        infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
        are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
        contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
        conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
        simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
        obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.
        For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
        of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
        you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
        refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

        If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
        particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
        the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

        It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
        other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
        section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
        distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many
        people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
        distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
        system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
        distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
        choice.

        This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
        consequence of the rest of this License.

        8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
        countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
        copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit
        geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
        distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In
        such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body
        of this License.

        9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
        General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in
        spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems
        or concerns.

        Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
        specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
        version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
        that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.
        If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may
        choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

        10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
        whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
        permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,
        write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.
        Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
        all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of
        software generally.

        NO WARRANTY

        11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
        THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
        STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
        PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
        INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
        FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
        PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,
        YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

        12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
        ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
        PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
        GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
        INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
        BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
        FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
        OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

        How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

        If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
        use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
        which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

        To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach
        them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion
        of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a
        pointer to where the full notice is found.

            One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.

            Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;

            This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
            under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free
            Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)
            any later version.

            This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
            ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or
            FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for
            more details.

            You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
            with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59
            Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA

        Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

        If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it
        starts in an interactive mode:

            Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes
            with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.  This is free
            software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions;
            type 'show c' for details.

        The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate
        parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may be
        called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be
        mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

        You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
        if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.  Here
        is a sample; alter the names:

            Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
            'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

        This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
        proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
        consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
        library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public
        License instead of this License.


        "CLASSPATH" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL

        Certain source files distributed by Oracle America and/or its affiliates are
        subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPL, but
        only where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's header
        the words "Oracle designates this particular file as subject to the "Classpath"
        exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file that accompanied this code."

            Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making
            a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and conditions of
            the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.

            As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
            permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
            executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,
            and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your
            choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,
            the terms and conditions of the license of that module.  An independent
            module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.  If
            you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of
            the library, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do
            so, delete this exception statement from your version.

               ====================================================


               Preamble
               ----------

               The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
               development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
               efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
               open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
               with others.

               The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
               redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
               fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
               redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
               names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
               however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
               requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
               to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.


               Definitions
               -------------

               "Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
               Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
               include source files, build scripts and documentation.

               "Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
               copyright statement(s).

               "Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
               distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

               "Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
               or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
               Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
               new environment.

               "Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
               writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.


               Permission &amp; Conditions
               ------------------------

               Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
               a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
               redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
               Software, subject to the following conditions:

               1. Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
                 in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

               2. Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
                 redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
                 contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
                 included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
                 in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
                 binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

               3. No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
                 Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
                 Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
                 presented to the users.

               4. The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
                 Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
                 Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
                 Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
                 permission.

               5. The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
                 must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
                 distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
                 remain under this license does not apply to any document created
                 using the Font Software.



               Termination
               -----------

               This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
               not met.


                   DISCLAIMER

                   THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,

          "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
          form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
          editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
          represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
          of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
          separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
          the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

          "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
          the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
          to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
          submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
          or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
          the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
          means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
          to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
          communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

          subsequently incorporated within the Work.

       2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
          this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
          worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
          copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
          publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
          Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

       3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
          this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
          worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
          (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
          use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
          where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
          by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
          Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
          with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
          institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
          cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
          or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
          or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
          granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
          as of the date such litigation is filed.

       4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
          Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
          modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
          meet the following conditions:

          (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
              Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

          (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
              stating that You changed the files; and

          (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
              that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
              attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
              excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
              the Derivative Works; and

          (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
              distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
              include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
              within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
              pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
              of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
              as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
              documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
              within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
              wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
              of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
              do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
              notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
              or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
              that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
              as modifying the License.

          You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
          may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
          for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
          for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
          reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
          the conditions stated in this License.

       5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
          any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
          by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
          this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
          Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
          the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
          with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

       6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
          names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
          except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
          origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

       7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
          agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
          Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
          WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
          implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
          of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
          PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
          appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
          risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

       8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
          whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
          unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
          negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
          liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
          incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
          result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
          Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
          work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
          other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
          has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

       9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
          the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
          and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
          or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
          License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
          on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
          of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
          defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
          incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
          of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

       APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

          To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
          boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
          replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
          the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
          comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
          file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
          same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
          identification within third-party archives.

    THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

    1. DEFINITIONS

    "Contribution" means:

    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and

    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

    i) changes to the Program, and

    ii) additions to the Program;

    where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.

    "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

    "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.

    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.

    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.

    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

    3. REQUIREMENTS

    A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:

    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

    b) its license agreement:

    i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

    ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;

    iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

    iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

    When the Program is made available in source code form:

    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

    Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.

    Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

    5. NO WARRANTY

    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

    7. GENERAL

    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

    This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.`,

    Version 3, 29 June 2007

    Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>

    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

    This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

    0. Additional Definitions.
    As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

    “The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

    An “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.

    A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the “Linked Version”.

    The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

    The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

    1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
    You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

    2. Conveying Modified Versions.
    If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:

    a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
    b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.
    3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
    The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
    b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.
    4. Combined Works.
    You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:

    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
    b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.
    c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
    d) Do one of the following:
    0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.
    1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.
    e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)
    5. Combined Libraries.
    You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
    6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

    If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.`,

       TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

       1. Definitions.

          "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,

          control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
          "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
          direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
          otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
          outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

          "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
          exercising permissions granted by this License.

          "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
          including but not limited to software source code, documentation
          source, and configuration files.

          "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
          transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
          not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
          and conversions to other media types.

          "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
          Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
          copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
          (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

          "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
          form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
          editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
          represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
          of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
          separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
          the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

          "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
          the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
          to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
          submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
          or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
          the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
          means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
          to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
          communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
          and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
          Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
          excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
          designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

          "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
          on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
          subsequently incorporated within the Work.

       2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
          this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
          worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
          copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
          publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
          Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

       3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
          this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
          worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
          (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
          use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
          where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
          by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
          Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
          with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
          institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
          cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
          or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
          or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
          granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
          as of the date such litigation is filed.

       4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
          Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
          modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
          meet the following conditions:

          (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
              Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

          (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
              stating that You changed the files; and

          (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
              that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
              attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
              excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
              the Derivative Works; and

          (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
              distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
              include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
              within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
              pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
              of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
              as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
              documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
              within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
              wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
              of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
              do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
              notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
              or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
              that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
              as modifying the License.

          You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
          may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
          for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
          for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
          reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
          the conditions stated in this License.

       5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
          any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
          by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
          this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
          Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
          the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
          with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

       6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
          names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
          except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
          origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

       7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
          agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
          Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
          WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
          implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
          of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
          PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
          appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
          risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

       8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
          whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
          unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
          negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
          liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
          incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
          result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
          Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
          work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
          other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
          has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

       9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
          the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
          and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
          or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
          License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
          on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
          of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
          defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
          incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
          of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

       APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

          To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
          boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
          replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
          the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate

          to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
          communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
          and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
          Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
          excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
          designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

          "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
          on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
          subsequently incorporated within the Work.

       2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
          this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
          worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
          copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
          publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
          Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

       3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
          this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
          worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
          (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
          use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
          where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
          by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
          Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
          with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
          institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
          cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
          or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
          or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
          granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
          as of the date such litigation is filed.

       4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
          Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
          modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
          meet the following conditions:

          (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
              Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

          (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
              stating that You changed the files; and

          (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
              that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
              attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
              excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
              the Derivative Works; and

          (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
              distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
              include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
              within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
              pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
              of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
              as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
              documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
              within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
              wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
              of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
              do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
              notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
              or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
              that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
              as modifying the License.

          You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
          may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
          for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
          for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
          reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
          the conditions stated in this License.

       5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
          any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
          by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
          this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
          Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
          the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
          with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

       6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
          names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
          except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
          origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

       7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
          agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
          Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
          WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
          implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
          of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
          PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
          appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
          risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

       8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
          whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
          unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
          negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
          liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
          incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
          result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
          Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
          work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
          other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
          has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

       9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
          the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
          and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
          or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
          License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
          on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
          of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
          defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
          incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
          of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

        1. This LICENSE AGREEMENT is between the Python Software Foundation
        ("PSF"), and the Individual or Organization ("Licensee") accessing and
        otherwise using this software ("Jython") in source or binary form and
        its associated documentation.

        2. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, PSF
        hereby grants Licensee a nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide
        license to reproduce, analyze, test, perform and/or display publicly,
        prepare derivative works, distribute, and otherwise use Jython alone

        or incorporates Jython or any part thereof, and wants to make
        the derivative work available to others as provided herein, then
        Licensee hereby agrees to include in any such work a brief summary of
        the changes made to Jython.

        OR ANY DERIVATIVE THEREOF, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF.

        6. This License Agreement will automatically terminate upon a material
        breach of its terms and conditions.

        BY CLICKING ON THE "ACCEPT" BUTTON WHERE INDICATED, OR BY INSTALLING,
        COPYING OR OTHERWISE USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ARE DEEMED TO HAVE AGREED TO
        THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.

        ______________________________________________________________________

        JPython version 1.1.x

          1. This LICENSE AGREEMENT is between the Corporation for National Research
             Initiatives, having an office at 1895 Preston White Drive, Reston, VA
             20191 ("CNRI"), and the Individual or Organization ("Licensee")
             accessing and using JPython version 1.1.x in source or binary form and
             its associated documentation as provided herein ("Software").

          2. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, CNRI
             hereby grants Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free,
             world-wide license to reproduce, analyze, test, perform and/or display
             publicly, prepare derivative works, distribute, and otherwise use the
             Software alone or in any derivative version, provided, however, that
             CNRI's License Agreement and CNRI's notice of copyright, i.e.,
             "Copyright (c)1996-1999 Corporation for National Research Initiatives;
             All Rights Reserved" are both retained in the Software, alone or in any
             derivative version prepared by Licensee.

             Alternatively, in lieu of CNRI's License Agreement, Licensee may
             substitute the following text (omitting the quotes), provided, however,
             that such text is displayed prominently in the Software alone or in any
             derivative version prepared by Licensee: "JPython (Version 1.1.x) is
             made available subject to the terms and conditions in CNRI's License
             Agreement. This Agreement may be located on the Internet using the
             following unique, persistent identifier (known as a handle):
             1895.22/1006. The License may also be obtained from a proxy server on
             the Web using the following URL: http://hdl.handle.net/1895.22/1006."

          3. In the event Licensee prepares a derivative work that is based on or
             incorporates the Software or any part thereof, and wants to make the
             derivative work available to the public as provided herein, then
             Licensee hereby agrees to indicate in any such work, in a prominently
             visible way, the nature of the modifications made to CNRI's Software.

          4. Licensee may not use CNRI trademarks or trade name, including JPython
             or CNRI, in a trademark sense to endorse or promote products or
             services of Licensee, or any third party. Licensee may use the mark
             JPython in connection with Licensee's derivative versions that are
             based on or incorporate the Software, but only in the form
             "JPython-based ___________________," or equivalent.

          5. CNRI is making the Software available to Licensee on an "AS IS" basis.
             CNRI MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. BY WAY
             OF EXAMPLE, BUT NOT LIMITATION, CNRI MAKES NO AND DISCLAIMS ANY
             REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY
             PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR THAT THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE WILL NOT INFRINGE
             ANY THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.

          6. CNRI SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR OTHER USERS OF THE SOFTWARE FOR
             ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LOSS AS A RESULT OF
             USING, MODIFYING OR DISTRIBUTING THE SOFTWARE, OR ANY DERIVATIVE
             THEREOF, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF. SOME STATES DO NOT
             ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY SO THE ABOVE DISCLAIMER
             MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE.

          7. This License Agreement may be terminated by CNRI (i) immediately upon
             written notice from CNRI of any material breach by the Licensee, if the
             nature of the breach is such that it cannot be promptly remedied; or
             (ii) sixty (60) days following notice from CNRI to Licensee of a
             material remediable breach, if Licensee has not remedied such breach
             within that sixty-day period.

          8. This License Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in all
             respects by the law of the State of Virginia, excluding conflict of law
             provisions. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to create any
             relationship of agency, partnership, or joint venture between CNRI and
             Licensee.

          9. By clicking on the "ACCEPT" button where indicated, or by installing,

        B. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
        =======================================================

        JPython was created in late 1997 by Jim Hugunin. Jim was also the
        primary developer while he was at CNRI. In February 1999 Barry Warsaw
        took over as primary developer and released JPython version 1.1.

        In October 2000 Barry helped move the software to SourceForge
        where it was renamed to Jython. Jython 2.0 and 2.1 were developed
        under the Jython specific license below.

        From the 2.2 release on, Jython contributors have licensed their
        contributions to the Python Software Foundation under a Contributor
        Agreement, so as to permit distribution under the Python Software Foundation
        license.

        The Python standard library developed for CPython is also used in Jython, and
        (like Jython itself) is provided under the Python Software Foundation
        license. See the file LICENSE_CPython.txt for details.

        The zxJDBC package was written by Brian Zimmer and originally licensed
        under the GNU Public License. The package is now licensed to the Python
        Software Foundation under a Contributor Agreement, so as to permit
        distribution under the Python Software Foundation license.

        Elements of the supporting libraries (appearing renamed in some Jython JARs)
        are covered by the Apache Software License.  See the file LICENSE_Apache.txt
        for details.

       TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

       1. Definitions.

          "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,

          direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
          otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
          outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

          "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
          exercising permissions granted by this License.

          "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
          including but not limited to software source code, documentation
          source, and configuration files.

          "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
          transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
          not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

          "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
          Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
          copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
          (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

          "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
          form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
          editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
          represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
          of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
          separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
          the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

          "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
          the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
          to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
          submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
          or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
          the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
          means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
          to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
          communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
          and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
          Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
          excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
          designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

          "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
          on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
          subsequently incorporated within the Work.

       2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
          this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
          worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
          copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
          publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
          Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

       3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
          this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
          worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
          (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
          use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
          where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
          by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
          Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
          with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
          institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
          cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
          or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
          or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
          granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
          as of the date such litigation is filed.

       4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
          Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
          modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
          meet the following conditions:

          (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
              Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

          (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
              stating that You changed the files; and

          (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
              that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
              attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
              excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
              the Derivative Works; and

          (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
              distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
              include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
              within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
              pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
              of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
              as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
              documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
              within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
              wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
              of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
              do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
              notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
              or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
              that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
              as modifying the License.

          You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
          may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
          for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
          for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
          reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
          the conditions stated in this License.

       5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
          any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
          by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
          this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
          Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
          the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
          with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

       6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
          names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
          except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
          origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

       7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
          agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
          Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
          WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
          implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
          of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
          PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
          appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
          risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

       8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
          whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
          unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
          negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
          liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
          incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
          result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
          Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
          work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
          other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
          has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

       9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
          the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
          and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
          or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
          License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
          on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
          of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
          defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
          incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
          of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
